For quadratic learning, with ant, episode-length  = 200, n_iterations=50, max_IS=40000, traj_batch_size=64, max_steps=200,
works well.
neural nets with batch 64 work much worse.

cubic learner with batch_size=64: very quickly hits maximum IS ratio, so not many iterations needed.

cubic learning on cheetah needs more iterations to hit maxIS limit.

quadratic learning on humanoid needs veeeery small learning rate

quadratic learning on reacher needs high sample size, like 5000

envs that depend on termination conditions to learn need to have n_envs put to a low number

things to talk about in presentation:
- Neural Nets Are Bad For Mujoco Tasks!!!
    -> use quadratic models, they learn much faster, requires less interactions, etc.
