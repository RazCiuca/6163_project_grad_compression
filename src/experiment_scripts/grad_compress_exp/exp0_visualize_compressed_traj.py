"""
Simply Run the trajectory compression for a bunch of the checkpoints we have, compressing the difference
from the given point, to the final weights of the trajectory, seeing what a trajectory like that looks like.

- how does the dot product of the traj we find look like as a function of CEM iteration?
- save the trajectories as videos
- now do a line search in the direction of the gradient of that trajectory
